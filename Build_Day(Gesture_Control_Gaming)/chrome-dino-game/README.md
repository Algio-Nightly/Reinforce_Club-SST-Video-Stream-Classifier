This is a dino runner game based on pygame which is controlled by gestures of the hands. 

**How to play**
- Show your entire palm (such that all fingers are standing) to make the dino jump
- Show any two fingers (whichever configuration youre comfortable with) to make the dino duck. Also you have to make it jump again using your palms to un-duck it.

**Advices**
- As the game is not fully optimised for experience and only for experimenting purposes, the game might not always function properly.
- Please make sure to make the gesture early as the hitboxes of the obstacles and the dino are large and the time to recognise the gesture also adds up to a small but significant time lag affecting gaming experience.
- Crossing even 100 on this would be considered an achievement because of its its complicated gameplay. Lmao
