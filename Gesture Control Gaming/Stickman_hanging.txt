#Hand Gesture Game Control System

This Python script enables hands-free control of games using hand gestures detected through a webcam. By tracking the number of fingers you raise, you can perform actions like jumping, moving, or pressing keys in real-time games.

The system is particularly useful for simple games that require repetitive actions, such as Subway Surfers, Chrome Dino, or other endless runner games.

##How It Works

The script uses CVZone's Hand Detector to identify your hand in the camera frame. It counts how many fingers are raised using the fingersUp function. Based on this count, it simulates keyboard actions with pyautogui:

0 fingers: Press the spacebar (e.g., jump in a game)

5 fingers: Release the spacebar

The webcam feed is mirrored to provide a natural interaction, and the detection works in real-time.

###Prerequisites

Before running the script, install the following Python libraries:

cvzone: A high-level computer vision library built on top of OpenCV.

opencv-python: The core OpenCV library.

pyautogui: For simulating keyboard inputs.

Install them using pip:

pip install cvzone opencv-python pyautogui

####Usage

Connect a webcam to your system.

Run the script:

python hand_gesture_game.py


Once running, open your game of choice. The system will detect your hand and control actions based on the number of fingers you raise.

To stop the script, press Ctrl + C in the terminal.

###Customization

The script can be easily customized:

Change the control keys: Modify the pyautogui.keyDown or pyautogui.keyUp functions to map gestures to different keys.

Adjust detection confidence: Change the detectionCon parameter in HandDetector to make detection more or less sensitive.

Add more gestures: Extend the script to trigger different keys based on different finger counts.

Example Code Snippet
hands, img = detector.findHands(img)
if hands:
    fingers = detector.fingersUp(hands[0])
    totalFingers = fingers.count(1)
    if totalFingers == 0:
        pyautogui.keyDown('space')
    if totalFingers == 5:
        pyautogui.keyUp('space')

###Contributing

Suggestions and improvements are welcome! You can add more gestures, map them to different game actions, or enhance detection for multiple hands.
