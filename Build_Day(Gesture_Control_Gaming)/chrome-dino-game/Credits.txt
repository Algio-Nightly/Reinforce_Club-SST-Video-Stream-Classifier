This is an implemntation of Pattern Rcognition and Live Video Analysis using opencv and cvzone using the Dino Game. The game was initially developed and still belongs to https://github.com/MaxRohowsky with his repo being https://github.com/MaxRohowsky/chrome-dinosaur .
I've used his code with necessary adjustments to fit the time lag between the gesture delivery and its detection, and also coded the gesture detection model.
The crux being, the game belongs to https://github.com/MaxRohowsky, but the gesture-control interface is mine, i.e., https://github.com/Salil-IND.
