Real Flight Simulator + Gesture Control

Real Flight Simulator is a browser-based game where you pilot planes, handle takeoffs, and landings right from your browser.

This project adds hand gesture controls using a webcam — gestures are converted into key presses (W, S, A, D, arrow keys) so you can fly the plane without a keyboard.

✨ Makes gameplay more immersive, fun, and surprising!
